# treasury_bonds_hedging
End-to-end Treasury bond hedging project: builds yield curves, prices bonds, computes DV01 and key-rate DV01s, and designs a regression-based hedge using IEF and TLT ETFs. Validates hedge performance through historical backtests and Monte Carlo simulations with a Vasicek model.
